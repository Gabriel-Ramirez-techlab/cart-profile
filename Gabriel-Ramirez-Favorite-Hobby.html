  <title1><strong>Walking</strong></title1>
  </body>
  <p>My favorite hobby is to go walking outside. Ever since I was a little
    kid I've always been known to go walking beyond what a normal person would enjoy.
    I spent my summer walking to different neighborhoods and making a mental grade of their lawns.
    I separated them into a tier list based on their effort and theme of yard. Cabiny forest, gardens, sands, pebbles, ect..,
    I saw many yards and I found that if I get a house, I'm getting a huge tree in it so it's easier to make the whole house look better. </p>
<title2><strong>Music</strong></title2>
<p>Music is a big part of my day to day life. I spend most of my time on buses or at school so when I'm stationary at a desk or sitting down
   I prefer to listen to something to take away from the dullness of the moment. I listen to metal, rock, rap, RNB, soul, reggae,
   classical, and some oprah. But I don't just listen to music but play it too. My favorite instrument is the piano but I own electric guitars,
   acoustic guitars, an upright piano, and keyboards. In all, it's fair to say music is a major contribution to my life.</p>
<title3><strong>Video Games</strong></title3>
<p>My first experience with video games comes from the fc big screen console. Playing God of War and the first call of duty introduced me into gaming.
  Nowadays I spend most of my time playing strictly ranked. On every game I play I let my username decide my time played
   and therefore my rank. I normally stop at diamond but for games that I get my username “Scorpion” on, I'll occasionally hop on to stay good.</p>
