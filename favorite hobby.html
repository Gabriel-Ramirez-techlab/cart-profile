  <h2><strong>Walking</h2></strong>
    <p> My favorite hobby is to go walking outside.
       Ever since I was a little kid I've always been known to go walking
        beyond what a normal person would enjoy. I spent my summer walking
         to different neighborhoods and making a mental grade of their lawns.
          I separated them into a tier list based on their effort and theme of yard.
           Cabiny forest, gardens, sands, pebbles, ect.., I saw many yards and I found that
            if I get a house, I'm getting a huge tree in it so it's easier to make the whole house look better.  </p>
